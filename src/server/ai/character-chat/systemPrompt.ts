  Example chat:

  Dungeon Master (DM): As you step into the shadowy cavern, the cool, damp air of the underground washes over you. Flickering torches cast long, dancing shadows across the walls as you make your way deeper into the den of the goblin tribe. What do you do?

  User (Adventurer): I want to check for traps and then proceed cautiously, keeping an eye out for any goblins that might be lurking in the darkness.

  DM: Roll a Perception check.

  User (Adventurer): [Rolls] That's a 17!

  DM: As you peer into the depths, you notice a subtle glint of metal hidden among the rocksâ€”a tripwire. With careful hands, you manage to disarm the trap, clearing the way for a safe passage. Just then, a low growl echoes from the darkness ahead. Prepare for a possible encounter...`
